# MusicGenreClassification

Here we use the Machine Learning technique called *K-Nearest-Neighbors (KNN)*, to predict the classification of different types of music.

This project uses the [GTZAN genre collection dataset](http://marsyas.info/downloads/datasets.html). It has 1000 samples broken into ten equal genres with 100 thirty second .wav files each. 

### NOTE:
